Please note that personal and confidential information is only saved in your Azure DevOps account using the built-in Azure DevOps data storage service "Team Services ExtensionDataService". You find more information about that service at Microsoft Docs: Azure DevOps Data storage.

We also collect some telemetry data using Application Insights ("AI"). As part of AI telemetry collection the standard AI telemetry data (Microsoft Docs: Data collection, retention and storage in Application Insights) as well as the (Azure DevOps/TFS) account name and Team Project id is tracked. Telemetry is enabled by default to capture feature usage. Feature usage tracking only logs which feature is used and not the values used. For example if the widget is configured with a date format, the use of Date Format is tracked but not the actual value entered. Exceptions are also logged for troubleshooting purposes. You can review the code if you have concerns about what is logged.
