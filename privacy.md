hosted within the existing products.

### Data storage
We are committed to protecting the security of your information. For that reason we only store your data inside Microsoft 
Azure DevOps Services infrastructure or your Azure DevOps Server infrastructure using Microsofts API for storing extension data in your 
account. The data is stored in your account/server and is only accessible by members of your accounts. No data other than anonymous usage 
data is transferred outside of the host products.

### Usage and Exception Tracking
To improve the quality and reliability of our products we make use of Microsoft Application Insights. We capture metrics on how fast 
extensions load, if there are any errors occuring and what parts of our extensions users load and interact with. This data does not 
intentionally contain personally identifiable information specific. However, some data could unintentionally contain information from 
your production data or specific to you if it were present in the diagnostic material collected. Examples of this is Exception that can 
potential include fragments of your data embedded in the exception message.
